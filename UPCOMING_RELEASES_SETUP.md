## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"

- Ensure your API key is correctly set in `config.yaml`
- Check that there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key

### "Service not configured"

- Verify the service URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure the service name matches exactly ("TV Shows" for Sonarr, "Movies" for Radarr)

### "No upcoming releases"

- Check if your Sonarr/Radarr has monitored content
- Verify the services are accessible from your dashboard

### CORS Issues

- Some Sonarr/Radarr setups may require CORS configuration
- Add your dashboard domain to the allowed origins in Sonarr/Radarr settings

## API Endpoints Used

- **Sonarr**: `GET /api/v3/calendar?start={date}&end={date}&unmonitored=false`
- **Radarr**: `GET /api/v3/calendar?start={date}&end={date}&unmonitored=false`

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in your local configuration
- No API keys are transmitted to external services
- All API calls are made directly from your browser to your services
