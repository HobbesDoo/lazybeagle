```

  description="Media Server"
  icon="ðŸŽ¬"
  :grid-width="1"
  :grid-height="1"

  status="online"
/>
```

### API Service Usage

```javascript
import { ApiService } from '@/services/api'

// Create a Sonarr client
const sonarr = ApiService.createSonarrClient('http://192.168.1.100:8989', 'your-api-key')

// Get series data
const series = await sonarr.get('/series')
```

## Grid Layout

The dashboard uses a 6x4 grid by default (6 columns, 4 rows) that scales responsively:

- Desktop: 6 columns
- Tablet: 4 columns
- Mobile: 2 columns
- Small mobile: 1 column

Cards can span multiple grid cells by setting `grid-width` and `grid-height` props.
